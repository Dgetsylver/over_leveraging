# Turbolong UX/UI Audit — 100 User Personas

## What Is Turbolong?

Turbolong is a **leveraged trading platform built on Stellar's Blend Protocol**. It enables users to open amplified long positions on Stellar-native assets (USDC, CETES, USTRY, TESOURO, XLM, etc.) through atomic recursive supply/borrow loops — all in a single transaction. Key capabilities:

- **Up to 12.9× leverage** on supported assets across multiple Blend pools (Etherfuse, Fixed, YieldBlox)
- **Vault automation** (DeFindex-powered) for managed, auto-rebalancing leverage positions
- **APY alerts** via Cloudflare Workers + D1 subscriptions
- **Multi-wallet support** (Freighter, xBull, Albedo, Lobstr, Hana)
- **Sub-5-second finality** thanks to Stellar's fast settlement
- Built with a TypeScript/Vite frontend, Soroban (Rust) smart contracts, and a responsive CSS-only UI

The interface centers on a trade view with asset tabs, a leverage slider, real-time health-factor (HF) monitoring, interest-rate curves, and a vault dashboard.

## The 100 Personas

Organized into 13 categories. Each persona includes: **background/personality**, **what they look for**, and **specific UX/UI improvement suggestions**.

---

## Category 1 — DeFi Power Users (Personas 1–10)

These users have deep DeFi experience, often across multiple chains. They want speed, data density, and precision controls.

---

### 1. Marcus — The Yield Optimizer
**Background:** 32-year-old ex-quant trader turned full-time DeFi participant. Manages $500k+ across 6 protocols simultaneously. Uses spreadsheets to track positions hourly.
**Looking for:** Maximum data density, granular controls, exportable data, no hand-holding.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- Add a **keyboard shortcut system** (e.g., `L` to open leverage slider, `C` to close position) — removes mouse dependency for fast actions.
- Surface the **3-kink interest rate curve parameters** (r_base, r_two, util_target) in a toggleable "Advanced Stats" panel without needing to read doc.md.
- Provide a **CSV/JSON position export** button in the dashboard for external analysis.
- Show **projected liquidation price** as a dollar/asset value alongside the health factor number.

---

### 2. Priya — The Multi-Chain Arbitrageur
**Background:** 28-year-old developer who runs bots across Ethereum, Solana, and now Stellar. Moves quickly; abandons UIs that require more than 3 clicks.
**Looking for:** API surface, low-latency interface, no loading spinners blocking action.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- Add a **public REST/GraphQL API** for position reads so bots can monitor without scraping the UI.
- Replace full-page loading states with **skeleton screens** so the UI layout is stable while data loads.
- Show **estimated transaction fee** before submission, not just success/failure post-submission.
- Add a **"Copy TX hash"** button directly on the transaction confirmation toast.

---

### 3. Diego — The Leverage Connoisseur
**Background:** 35-year-old who treats leverage trading as his primary income. Has blown up accounts before and now obsesses over HF management.
**Looking for:** Real-time HF updates as he adjusts leverage, clear liquidation warnings, granular position sizing.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- The leverage slider should update the **HF preview in real-time** (before submission) — currently it may only show final state.
- Add **color-coded HF zones**: green (>2.0), yellow (1.5–2.0), orange (1.2–1.5), red (<1.2) with persistent visual indicator in the header while a position is open.
- Allow **manual HF target input**: type `1.8` and the slider auto-sets to the corresponding leverage.
- Add a **"Safe Max"** button that auto-sets leverage to the maximum that keeps HF above a user-defined threshold.

---

### 4. Kenji — The Gas Optimizer
**Background:** 40-year-old DeFi veteran from Ethereum who moved to Stellar specifically for low fees. Extremely cost-aware; tracks fee-to-profit ratios.

- Show **rate trend arrows** (↑↓) next to APY values, with 24h and 7d change percentages.
- Allow **pool switching without closing position** (where protocol mechanics allow) or at least show the migration cost.
- Integrate a **"Best Rate" badge** on the pool/asset combination offering the highest net APY.

---

**Background:** 74-year-old who takes 2–3 days to make financial decisions. Doesn't like being rushed.
**Looking for:** Save-and-return flows, no session timeouts, persistent application state.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- **Save form state** locally so users can start filling in a position and return days later.
- Avoid **short session timeouts** that disconnect wallets — or at least warn before disconnecting.
- Add a **"Review later"** bookmark feature to save a pool/asset/leverage combination for future consideration.
- Show **"You were working on this"** reminder when the user returns after a pause.

---

### 92. Barbara — The Partner-Dependent User
**Background:** 69-year-old who makes financial decisions with her spouse. Needs to share information easily.
**Looking for:** Shareable position summaries, print/email capabilities, easy information forwarding.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- Add **"Share this with someone"** — a shareable link (read-only) to a position summary or product explainer.
- Enable **"Print this page"** functionality with a clean print-optimized CSS stylesheet.

## Category 12 — Privacy-Focused Users (Personas 93–95)

Users who prioritize on-chain privacy and minimal data collection.

---

### 93. Cypherpunk Carl — The Privacy Absolutist
**Background:** 36-year-old who uses Tor, self-hosts everything, and is deeply skeptical of any data collection.
**Looking for:** No analytics tracking, no external CDN dependencies, self-hostable interface.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- Add a **privacy policy** that clearly states no user data is collected and no analytics are embedded.
- Audit and remove **third-party scripts** — ensure no Google Analytics, Hotjar, or similar.

**UX/UI Suggestions:**
- Confirm **no KYC** is required and never add identity verification steps that aren't required by Stellar itself.
- Avoid **correlating wallet addresses** across sessions or displaying social graph information.

---

### 100. Isabelle — The Vault Social Investor
**Background:** 26-year-old who follows crypto influencers and joins vaults based on community recommendations.
**Looking for:** Social proof, easy sharing, community around the vault.
**UX/UI Suggestions:**

## Top Recurring Improvement Themes

Based on analysis across all 100 personas, these 12 themes appear most frequently and represent the highest-impact improvement opportunities:

---

### 1. Onboarding & Progressive Disclosure (34 personas)
The biggest gap: the UI drops new users directly into a complex DeFi trading interface with no guided path. **Recommendation:** Build a multi-mode onboarding system — Beginner / Intermediate / Expert — with the default being Beginner for first-time users. An interactive 6-step tour and "What is X?" tooltips on all metrics would serve 30%+ of the addressable audience.

---

### 2. Risk Communication & Transparency (28 personas)
HF is the critical safety metric but is presented without enough context. **Recommendation:** Color-code HF with four zones (safe/caution/warning/danger), show "liquidation price" in asset terms alongside HF, and add a "Stress Test" button showing position health if rates move adversely. Every risk-averse persona cited this as the top need.

---

### 3. Mobile-First Optimization (22 personas)
The current UI works on mobile but was designed desktop-first. **Recommendation:** Redesign the mobile interaction pattern with bottom-sheet modals, thumb-reachable CTAs, and a PWA manifest. Sub-500KB initial load and offline state caching would unlock the emerging market user base.

---

### 4. Data Export & API Access (20 personas)
Both power users and institutional users need programmatic access. **Recommendation:** Publish a public REST API for position reads, a TypeScript SDK (the blend.ts/defindex.ts files are nearly there), and CSV export for all position history. This also serves compliance, reporting, and automation needs.

---

### 5. Accessibility (WCAG Compliance) (18 personas)
Multiple accessibility gaps exist: color-only information encoding, no ARIA labels on interactive elements, small tap targets. **Recommendation:** Conduct a WCAG 2.1 AA audit and resolve all Level A and AA violations. Priority: ARIA labels on the leverage slider, keyboard navigation, and color-blind-safe HF indicator.

---

### 6. Vault Product Positioning (16 personas)
The vault is an underutilized product that solves the main pain points for passive investors, beginners, and busy professionals. **Recommendation:** Make the vault a co-equal first-class product on the homepage — not a secondary tab. "Earn enhanced yield, fully automated" is a stronger hook for 50%+ of personas than "open a leveraged position."

---

### 7. Internationalization & Localization (15 personas)
Turbolong's core assets (CETES, USTRY, TESOURO) have natural appeal in LatAm, but the UI is English-only. **Recommendation:** Add Spanish and Portuguese as first priority languages. RTL support for Arabic. Local currency display (ARS, MXN, BRL, NGN) for contextual returns.

---

### 8. Real-Time Alerts & Notifications (14 personas)
The APY alert system exists but is not discoverable, and there's no HF alert system. **Recommendation:** Add HF threshold alerts (email + push) as a first-class feature. Surface the alerts system prominently in the UI header. Build a weekly digest email summarizing position health and rate changes.

---

### 9. Comparative Rate Intelligence (13 personas)
Users want to know if they're getting the best available rate. **Recommendation:** Add a "Compare Pools" view showing all pool/asset combinations by net APY. Show 24h/7d rate trend arrows. Add a "Best Rate" badge and switching cost calculator.

---

### 10. Pre-Transaction Transparency (12 personas)
Users want to see exactly what will happen before signing a transaction. **Recommendation:** Add a pre-transaction summary screen for every action showing: what will change, estimated fees in XLM, expected post-transaction HF, and estimated gas cost. A "Dry Run" simulation mode would also serve power users.

---

### 11. Developer Experience & Documentation (11 personas)
No public developer documentation exists. The existing code quality (blend.ts, leverage.rs) is high, but undiscoverable. **Recommendation:** Create a simple developer docs site, publish the TypeScript integration code as an npm package, and add a `security.txt` + bug bounty program link in the UI.

---

### 12. Trust Signals & Security Transparency (10 personas)
Multiple skeptical and security-conscious personas cited the lack of visible trust signals. **Recommendation:** Add a "Security" page linking to: GitHub source code, audit reports (exist in the repo), bug bounty program, contract addresses, and Stellar Expert links. Surface contract addresses with one-click copy on the pool selector.
